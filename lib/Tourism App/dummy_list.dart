Volcanic eruptions | IFRC
A volcano is an opening in the earth's surface that allows magma (hot liquid and semi-liquid rock), volcanic ash and gases to escape. They are generally found where tectonic plates come together or separate, but they can also occur in the middle of plates due to volcanic hotspots.'''
